# jsendpraat

Praat (http://praat.org) is a popular phonetics tool developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink at the University of Amsterdam. Praat can receive commands from other programs using a mechanism called "sendpraat".

*jsendpraat*, developed by the NZILBB at the University of Canterbury (http://www.nzilbb.canterbury.ac.nz), includes a Java implementation of sendpraat, and browser extensions (for Chrome and Friefox), allowing interaction with Praat from a web browser. These extensions were developed primarily for use with LaBB-CAT, a brower-based linguistics tool (https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz), but can be used to open embedded audio in Praat from any web page.

This directory contains code and resources for the Firefox extension.

During the build process, cross-browser code/resource are copied/merged here from ../extension
