    <h1>jsendpraat Test Page</h1>

    <p> Praat (<a href="http://praat.org">http://praat.org</a>) is a popular phonetics tool
      developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink at the University of Amsterdam. Praat can
      receive commands from other programs using a mechanism called "sendpraat".</p> 
    
    <p> <i>jsendpraat</i>, developed by the NZILBB at the University of Canterbury
      (<a href="http://www.nzilbb.canterbury.ac.nz">http://www.nzilbb.canterbury.ac.nz</a>),
      includes a Java implementation of sendpraat, and a browser extension (for Chrome and
      Firefox), allowing interaction with Praat from a web browser. These extensions were
      developed primarily for use with LaBB-CAT, a brower-based linguistics tool
      (<a href="https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz">https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz</a>), but
      can be used to open embedded audio in Praat from any web page.</p> 
    
    <p> This page can be used for testing the functionality of jsendpraat.</p>

    <p> If the extension is installed and working properly, you should be able to see a
      Praat icon above, to the right of the URL in the address bar of your browser.</p> 

    <p> If you click that icon, you should see three URLs listed: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> A file called <i>link.wav</i> which is detected from the following link:<br>
        <a href="link.wav" title="A direct link to a .wav file">link.wav</a></li>
      <li> A file called <i>fragment.wav</i> which is detected from the following link to a
        wav fragment:<br>
        <a href="fragment.wav#t=0.3,0.6" title="A direct link to a .wav fragment">
          fragment.wav#t=0.3,0.6</a></li>
      <li> A file called <a>audio-src.wav</a> which is detected from this following audio
        control:<br> 
        <audio src="audio-src.wav" controls></audio></li>
      <li> A file called <a>audio-source.wav</a> which is detected from this following
        audio control:<br> 
        <audio controls>
          <source src="audio-source.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>
      </li>
    </ul>
